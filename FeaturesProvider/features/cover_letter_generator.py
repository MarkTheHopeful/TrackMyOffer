    Please write a complete cover letter in a {style} style.

    **Applicant Information:**
    - Name: {applicant_name}
    - Email: {applicant_email}
    - Phone: {applicant_phone}
    - Current Location: {applicant_location}
    - Personal Summary/About Me: {applicant_summary}
    
    **Job Details:**

    **Company Contact (for salutation):**
    - Contact Person: {recruiter_name}
    - Company Name: {company_name}

    **Additional Notes/Instructions from Applicant, what they want to add to the cover letter:**
    {notes if notes else "No specific notes provided."}

    **Task:**
    Generate a full, ready-to-send cover letter. The letter should be well-structured and include:
    1.  Applicant's Contact Information (e.g., {applicant_name}, {applicant_email}, {applicant_phone} at the top or bottom).
    2.  Date: {current_date_str}.
    3.  Recipient's Details: {recruiter_name}, {company_name}. (If a company address is available from job_description, it can be included; otherwise, omit.)
    4.  Salutation (e.g., "Dear {recruiter_name},").
    5.  Introduction: Clearly state you are applying for the {job_title} at {company_name}.
    6.  Body Paragraphs:
        - Express strong interest in the role and {company_name}.
        - Highlight how your skills and experiences (from your Personal Summary: "{applicant_summary}") match the job's requirements and responsibilities. Be specific and provide examples if possible.
        - Explain why you are a good fit for the company culture and this specific role.
        - If provided, subtly weave in points from the 'Additional Notes'.
    7.  Conclusion: Reiterate your enthusiasm for the opportunity and state your availability for an interview or further discussion.
    8.  Closing (e.g., "Sincerely," or "Yours faithfully,").
    9.  Your Typed Name: {applicant_name}.

    **Important Instructions:**
    - The tone must be strictly {style}.
    - Do not use placeholders (e.g., '[Your Address]', '[Company Address]')!!!!!!!! If specific information is not available, omit it or rephrase the content so that it appears complete and professional without it.
    - The output should be ONLY the cover letter text. No extra explanations, introductions, or markdown formatting like "```" surrounding the letter.
    - Ensure the letter is professional, grammatically correct, and flows naturally.
    
    The final version must look polished and ready to use as-isÑŽ
